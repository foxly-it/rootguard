# RootGuard project state

Last updated: 2026-08-05

This file is the persistent handover for future development sessions. Read it
before repeating repository-wide discovery.

## Repository layout

- `foxly-it/rootguard` coordinates deployment, documentation, CI, and website.
- `foxly-it/rootguard-core` owns privileged orchestration and configuration.
- `foxly-it/rootguard-webapp` owns the authenticated backend proxy and React UI.
- `foxly-it/rootguard-unbound` is also usable as a standalone resolver image.

The component repositories are included in the main repository as Git
submodules. Component PRs are merged before their revisions are updated here.

## Runtime architecture

```text
Browser --HttpOnly session--> WebApp --Bearer token--> Core --Docker API--> services
Network clients --TCP/UDP 53--> AdGuard Home --> Unbound --> DNS hierarchy
```

- Only the WebApp and DNS port are published.
- AdGuard administration, Core, and the Docker socket remain internal.
- AdGuard forwards exclusively to Unbound at `172.29.53.2:5335`.
- Router clients use the fixed LAN address of the RootGuard host, not localhost
  or the internal Docker address.

## Delivered and verified

- Secure AdGuard Home first-time setup through RootGuard.
- Generated AdGuard credentials remain in Core's persistent data volume.
- Unbound runs read-only, non-root, without additional capabilities.
- Unbound 1.25.2 is compiled from the SHA-256-verified official NLnet Labs
  source on a digest-pinned Debian 13 Slim multi-stage base. Direct packages are
  version-pinned and verified through Debian's signed repository metadata; the
  `amd64`/`arm64` publication includes SBOM and provenance attestations. The
  component image passed configuration, recursive DNS, DNSSEC, trust-anchor,
  health, read-only, capability-free, and multi-architecture build checks.
  The Core-managed update from the prior image to the published source build
  also passed on Docker Desktop/arm64: update history recorded success, the
  container stayed healthy as `100:101`, AdGuard resolved through it, signed
  answers carried the `ad` flag, the broken DNSSEC test returned `SERVFAIL`,
  and startup logs were clean. A Debian 13 `amd64` LXC then passed the immutable
  alpha clean install, Core-managed update from the alpha image to the published
  source build, and an injected failure rollback. The rollback restored the
  exact prior image ID, kept the resolver healthy, retained recursive DNS, and
  recorded `rolled_back`; the restored image also passed source-checksum,
  DNSSEC, and clean-log checks. The host was returned to zero test containers,
  volumes, and RootGuard networks afterward.
- Unbound keeps a stable non-root identity (`100:101`) across image rebuilds,
  uses the system socket send buffer, and Core migrates the persistent resolver
  state ownership with a network-isolated, capability-restricted helper before
  image replacement. The WebApp update path from 1.22.0 to 1.25.2 was verified
  with a writable DNSSEC trust anchor, clean startup logs, positive resolution,
  and DNSSEC rejection.
- Authenticated Unbound settings for QNAME minimisation, prefetch,
  serve-expired, cache TTLs, and resolver threads.
- Side-effect-free change preview and generated configuration display.
- `unbound-checkconf` validation before activation.
- Atomic activation, automatic restart rollback, 20-version history, and
  confirmed restore through the WebGUI.
- Fixed diagnostics for configuration, recursive resolution, and DNSSEC.
- Four validated Unbound operating profiles (balanced, privacy, resilience,
  and performance) that load only as drafts.
- Deterministic draft advice for privacy, availability, cache efficiency, and
  resource usage, including explanations and recommended value ranges.
- Separate `90-rootguard-custom.conf` expert editor with generic syntax
  highlighting, templates, prefix completion, contextual documentation, risk
  labels, deterministic advice, and a 64 KiB limit.
- Custom configuration policy blocks file includes, listeners, remote control,
  trust-anchor changes, DNSSEC bypasses, and values owned by guided settings.
- Candidate and effective `unbound-checkconf` validation plus atomic activation;
  guided settings and custom content share history and rollback.
- Integration CI starts the complete stack and verifies AdGuard bootstrap,
  Unbound preview/apply/history/diagnostics/restore, positive DNS, and DNSSEC
  rejection.
- AIO bootstrap split: the default Compose model starts WebApp, Core, and the
  internal control-plane updater; an authenticated Setup page performs typed
  network preflight and starts the managed Unbound/AdGuard data plane
  asynchronously.
- Persistent installation state and progress, atomic generated Compose state,
  private AdGuard administration, managed-resource labels, and controller
  network reconciliation after replacement.
- AIO deployment verified end to end on Docker Desktop/aarch64 with an explicit
  loopback bind: image pull, container creation, Unbound health, delayed
  AdGuard installer readiness, protected bootstrap, positive DNS, DNSSEC
  rejection, persistent state, and controller replacement reconciliation.
- Core handles SIGTERM with a bounded HTTP shutdown so planned container stops
  and replacements exit cleanly instead of appearing as crashes.
- Dashboard rebuilt around real installation, service, DNSSEC, bind, and
  protected-upstream state. It now adds live aggregate CPU and memory usage for
  the five allowlisted RootGuard containers plus aggregate AdGuard Home query,
  blocked-query, and filter-rate values without exposing query names or clients.
- AdGuard page documents and visualises the RootGuard-managed official installer
  flow instead of suggesting that the native administration wizard must remain
  public.
- WebApp text actions now share explicit primary, secondary, and destructive
  button variants across Dashboard, Setup, Stack, Unbound, and AdGuard while
  tabs, selectable cards, completion entries, and icon-only controls retain
  their interaction-specific styling. The AdGuard overview prioritises the
  persistent RootGuard AIO operating context; its on-demand local filter check
  opens immediately in a focused, scroll-safe dialog with progress, retry,
  error, summary, and per-host results.
- On-demand AdGuard filtering diagnostics use the local authenticated
  `check_host` API for advertising and tracking probes without opening test
  websites. Legitimate services and AMTSO/Wicar portals remain explicitly
  informational. RootGuard also reconciles a conservative DNS baseline through
  AdGuard's validated API: exclusive Unbound upstream, no fallback, filtering,
  DNSSEC signalling, disabled ECS, refused ANY requests, bounded cache and
  response TTLs, and daily filter refreshes.
- Authenticated native AdGuard Home UI gateway at `/adguard-ui/`; AdGuard still
  has no public administration port, Core injects its private credentials, and
  mutating browser requests are restricted to the same origin.
- Read-only live Unbound configuration endpoint reads the actual base and
  managed files from the running container; the settings UI shows the active
  file alongside directive-level explanations, and newly rendered managed
  configurations contain comments for every guided setting.
- Guided local-zone assistant in the Unbound UI creates and edits multiple
  A, AAAA, and CNAME records without requiring Unbound syntax. Its generated
  block remains visible in the expert configuration, preserves unrelated
  custom rules, detects concurrent edits, and uses the existing preview,
  effective `unbound-checkconf`, versioning, activation, and rollback pipeline.
- Guided conditional forwarding manages multiple canonical zones with ordered
  IPv4/IPv6 targets and an explicit, default-off recursive fallback. Core
  rejects root-zone, duplicate, loopback, link-local, multicast, RootGuard
  network, and expert-forwarding conflicts; a bounded authenticated probe
  requires every target to return `NOERROR` and an SOA record for the configured
  zone from the running Unbound container before WebGUI activation. Rejected
  responses expose a stable, bounded status explanation instead of raw resolver
  output.
  DNSSEC validation remains the per-zone default; trusted unsigned private
  servers require an explicit, visible `allow_unsigned` opt-in that renders a
  scoped `domain-insecure`. Rebinding protection likewise remains enabled by
  default; a separate visible `allow_private_addresses` opt-in renders a scoped
  `private-domain` for trusted RFC1918/private answers. Forwarding settings use
  the shared preview, effective `unbound-checkconf`, version history, restart
  rollback, and restore lifecycle.
- Guided private DNS manages canonical `private-domain` entries and an explicit
  NXDOMAIN-or-transparent policy for each RFC1918 reverse range. NXDOMAIN is the
  safe default; transparent fallback carries a visible leakage warning. Guided
  A/AAAA records can generate `local-data-ptr` only when the address is unique
  across the complete guided draft. Core validation, expert conflict checks,
  preview, effective `unbound-checkconf`, history, activation, and rollback all
  cover the new settings. AdGuard Home's own private reverse-resolver routing
  remains an integration responsibility rather than duplicated resolver logic.
- Guided resolver protocol mode defaults to IPv4 and offers dual-stack or
  IPv6-only operation only after the running Unbound container reaches an
  authoritative root server over IPv6. Core repeats this decision server-side
  during activation, renders `do-ip4`, `do-ip6`, and `prefer-ip6`, blocks expert
  duplication, and keeps preview, checkconf, history, and rollback intact.
- Client CIDR policy intentionally remains owned by AdGuard Home: Unbound is an
  internal resolver reached by AdGuard, so a separate end-client access editor
  in RootGuard would be ineffective duplication.
- Unbound information architecture split into accessible Overview, Resolver,
  Local DNS, and Advanced tabs. The landing view now shows only configuration
  status, profile, versions, extensions, and on-demand diagnostics; cache
  tuning, live files, expert rules, and rollback use progressive disclosure.
  Tabs support arrow-key navigation, clear focus states, responsive overflow,
  and labelled tab panels without changing the validation and rollback paths.
- Guided Unbound text, number, and select controls share the Setup page's
  consistent field height, surface, border, typography, and visible focus
  treatment across local zones, forwarding, private domains, and resolver
  tuning. Stack runtime badges center their pulsing indicator independently of
  browser text baselines for stable Safari rendering.
- Extensible WebApp localisation registry with German and English catalogs,
  browser-language detection, persistent selection, document language and
  locale-aware date/number formatting. Navigation, setup, dashboard, stack
  lifecycle, AdGuard, guided Unbound settings, profiles, advisor, history and
  expert-editor controls use stable catalog keys; additional locale packages
  register without changing component or API logic.
- The former Overview entry is now the canonical Dashboard route. Setup uses a
  guided DNS-path blueprint, progress rail, endpoint preview, and compact
  deployment cards; Stack and Unbound share the Dashboard visual language.
  Subtle page, status, loading, and interaction motion is disabled automatically
  when the browser requests reduced motion.
- Browser Basic Auth has been replaced by a bilingual responsive login screen
  backed by expiring server-side sessions. The session cookie is HttpOnly and
  SameSite Strict, administration APIs and the AdGuard gateway reject missing
  sessions, same-origin checks cover login/logout, and the header exposes an
  explicit sign-out action. Sessions persist in a dedicated restricted volume
  so a controlled WebApp replacement does not force an unnecessary login.
- The bilingual login includes local password recovery through a separate
  installation recovery key. Successful resets persist only a salted
  PBKDF2-SHA256 verifier in the restricted session volume and invalidate every
  active session. The recovery key neither creates a session nor crosses the
  WebApp/Core trust boundary; installations without one receive the explicit
  local `.env` recovery procedure instead of a misleading email flow.
- Lightweight vector RootGuard shield replaces the former embedded bitmap
  asset. The global header now identifies the current page next to the brand;
  the application shell adds a keyboard skip link, labelled main navigation,
  focusable content target, and responsive page-name treatment. On desktop the
  primary sidebar can now collapse to its Lucide symbols, retains accessible
  labels and hover/focus tooltips, and remembers the local preference; mobile
  navigation remains fully labelled.
- The next WebGUI development slice is specified with verifiable acceptance
  criteria for a consistent utility header, local bilingual settings search,
  System/Light/Dark appearance, a bottom-anchored sticky sidebar control, and
  keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, responsive, and WCAG 2.2 AA validation.
- RootGuard Core now publishes a contributor-facing reference for every current
  internal API route. It identifies `/api/health` as the sole unauthenticated
  endpoint, documents the bearer-token boundary and route groups, and uses only
  representative sanitized request and response shapes.
- The standalone Unbound image now documents a rootless Podman quick start with
  loopback-only TCP/UDP publication and persistent configuration and trust-anchor
  volumes. The instructions were verified on macOS/arm64 with rootless Podman
  6.0.2: signed recursion carried the `ad` flag, broken DNSSEC returned
  `SERVFAIL`, and the same volumes remained valid across container recreation.
- Stack & Updates page for allowlisted AdGuard Home and Unbound lifecycle
  control. Update checks compare pulled and running image IDs; installation is
  asynchronous and persistent, creates protected data backups, replaces one
  service, performs DNS-chain health checks, and automatically restores the
  previous image and backup on failure.
- Stack Center runtime cards expose bounded Docker metadata for each DNS
  service: plain-language state guidance, health result, image version and
  immutable ID, start time, restart count, and actually published ports.
  Raw daemon output remains outside this endpoint.
- Container health reporting distinguishes an absent Docker healthcheck from
  a genuinely unknown inspection result. The official AdGuard Home image
  therefore appears as a normally running service without a configured Docker
  healthcheck instead of producing a misleading operator warning; starting,
  unhealthy, stopped, and indeterminate states retain their warning severity.
- Service diagnostics are loaded only after an explicit user action and are
  limited to 100 lines from the previous 30 minutes and 64 KiB. Core removes
  control characters and redacts common authorization, token, password,
  secret, and API-key patterns. The WebGUI explains the window and reminds
  operators to review diagnostic text before sharing it.
- Separate internal control-plane updater for allowlisted Core and WebApp
  images. It remains alive while both containers are replaced as a pair,
  persists status outside either target, verifies exact image IDs and both
  health endpoints, and pins both previous images if either check fails.
  Browser requests cannot supply images, services, or Compose arguments.
- Updater source and history live in the independently versioned
  `foxly-it/rootguard-updater` component repository. Its own CI runs tests,
  vetting, and `amd64`/`arm64` image builds; the main repository pins the exact
  reviewed component commit as a Git submodule. The GHCR package explicitly
  grants the updater repository write access for Actions; its `latest` and
  commit tags were republished successfully as a multi-architecture manifest
  on 2026-07-29.
- The Updater CI also runs two real Docker scenarios with old and new
  Core/WebApp fixture images. It verifies both running image IDs after a paired
  update, then introduces an HTTP-503 WebApp candidate and proves that both
  previous image IDs are restored with a persisted `rolled_back` outcome.
- Bilingual project website deployed with enforced HTTPS at
  `https://rootguard.foxly.de`.
- GitHub-backed project overview on the website with current version, open
  pull requests, recent commits, and a release update log. The Pages workflow
  refreshes its public data during every deployment and every six hours, with
  a checked-in local fallback.
- Reduced public landing page focused on a plain-language product explanation,
  a Compose quick start, three user benefits, and a compact project status.
  Technical depth stays in the documentation, whose table of contents highlights the
  section currently in view. The dashboard header preview mirrors the live
  WebApp's Lucide symbols for endpoint, services, DNSSEC, filter chain, CPU,
  memory, query, blocked-query, and filter-rate cards instead of substituting
  unrelated text glyphs.
- Public alpha `v0.1.0-alpha.5` is published around a single
  `compose.alpha.yaml` that
  contains no local build contexts and pulls one named RootGuard version for
  Core, WebApp, Updater, and Unbound. Component-owned tag workflows publish
  `amd64` and `arm64` images, after which
  the main release workflow smoke-tests the published Compose through the real
  guided AIO installation, DNS resolution, and DNSSEC rejection path.
- Dedicated bilingual documentation at `/docs.html` covering installation,
  first setup, router and client configuration, the WebGUI, Unbound, AdGuard
  Home, updates and rollback, security, operations, troubleshooting, and
  environment configuration. The WebApp header now links there instead of the
  unrelated Foxly corporate site.
- Bilingual Wiki hub at `/wiki.html` and public release roadmap at
  `/roadmap.html`. Root `ROADMAP.md` is the canonical checklist through 1.0,
  with release gates for public alpha, useful Unbound administration, DNS
  policy, recovery, security, beta engineering, release candidate, and stable
  Docker appliance. Website status and dashboard mock now describe delivered
  capabilities, including the delivered privacy-preserving live stack and
  AdGuard Home metrics.
- Consistent public-site header navigation keeps Docs and quick start directly
  reachable, groups Wiki, project status, and roadmap under
  Project, and groups the Foxly tool overview, MOTD, and AdGuard Home updater
  separately. Keyboard-friendly native dropdowns close on outside click or
  Escape, and the language switch is integrated into the navigation surface.
  A dedicated GitHub icon beside the navigation links directly to the repository.
  RootGuard now carries its own bilingual imprint and privacy notice
  tailored to the static GitHub Pages deployment instead of redirecting legal
  links to the Foxly blog.
- Detailed Unbound configuration ownership and priority plan in
  `docs/unbound-configuration-roadmap.md`: fixed secure base, typed guided
  values, guarded expert directives, and permanently blocked browser controls.
- Repository-wide AGPL-3.0-or-later licensing for the main project, Core,
  WebApp, Unbound, and Updater. A separate trademark notice keeps RootGuard and
  Foxly IT names and visual identity outside the software license and asks
  modified distributions to use distinct branding.

## Current development slice

Trustworthy Stack Center and production visibility:

- real service state, health, image reference, immutable image ID, start time,
  restart count, and published ports, presented with plain-language guidance;
- completed data-plane updates and paired Core/WebApp updates through the
  separate helper; the public alpha Compose now records and pins every
  RootGuard and AdGuard multi-architecture manifest digest;
- bounded update and rollback history survives restarts and is shown in the
  Stack Center together with each automatic cleanup result;
- post-update cleanup retains the active and previous successful image, removes
  only older image IDs recorded by RootGuard, and considers only unused volumes
  carrying the explicit `io.rootguard.cleanup=true` label;
- safe start, stop, and restart controls with clear impact;
- bounded, redacted on-demand service logs and actionable failure states;
- Stack Center runtime inspection now covers Core, WebApp, the independent
  Updater helper, AdGuard Home, and Unbound through Core's fixed allowlist. It
  exposes OCI version, revision, creation time, source, and manifest-digest
  pinning, while the bilingual UI visibly distinguishes immutable references,
  mutable tags, local builds, and complete, partial, or unavailable metadata.
  OCI labels remain provenance hints, while immutable Core/WebApp releases are
  now checked cryptographically with pinned Cosign against SLSA provenance,
  the exact GitHub repository/workflow identity, GitHub Actions OIDC issuer,
  and Sigstore transparency data. Verified, missing, invalid, unavailable, and
  non-applicable results remain distinct and are cached for ten minutes.
  Alpha 4 predates the signed publication step and is therefore expected to
  report a missing attestation; RootGuard does not retroactively claim build
  provenance. The next coordinated release is the first verifiable release.
- typed, bilingual AIO installation diagnostics for invalid host addresses,
  missing Compose, occupied DNS ports, failed image pulls, and interrupted
  deployment recovery; raw technical details remain available on demand.
- guided AdGuard Home release-channel selection with Stable as the
  backward-compatible default and an explicit bilingual Beta warning. Core
  accepts only the `stable`/`beta` enum and resolves both to administrator-set,
  allowlisted image references; the public alpha Beta reference is pinned to
  its verified multi-architecture manifest.
- guarded public-alpha clean-install verifier shared by Docker Desktop and
  native GitHub-hosted Linux `amd64`/`arm64` jobs; it refuses existing
  RootGuard resources, validates login, AIO deployment, recursive DNS and
  DNSSEC rejection, then removes only resources created by the test. Docker
  Desktop `arm64` and both native Linux jobs passed on 2026-07-28; the Linux
  evidence is Actions run `30353823582`.
- fixed Dashboard service KPI: the active/total count now derives from the
  live five-service allowlist response instead of a hardcoded value, so a
  fully healthy stack shows `5 / 5` rather than a stale `X / 2`
  ([rootguard-webapp#50](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-webapp/pull/50)).
- semantic design tokens and a System/Light/Dark theme system
  (`localStorage`-persisted, zero-FOUC) for the app shell and first screen -
  header, sidebar, buttons, cards, status indicators, and login. Fixed 8
  previously-referenced-but-undefined CSS custom properties and a dead
  duplicate `.sidebar` rule along the way. Every light-theme text/background
  pair is WCAG AA contrast-verified. Dashboard, Setup, Stack Center,
  AdGuard, and the Unbound settings pages are also migrated
  ([rootguard-webapp#54](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-webapp/pull/54),
  [#56](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-webapp/pull/56),
  [#58](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-webapp/pull/58)). Code/config
  viewers (the Unbound expert editor, live-config viewer, log and
  diagnostic panels) intentionally stay dark under both themes, like a
  code block. The theme-tokens roadmap item is now fully delivered.
- header reworked as a coherent utility bar: language, theme, sign-out,
  GitHub, and Docs now share one visual language (height, border, radius,
  icon size, hover, focus-visible), including a fix for GithubIcon/DocsIcon
  rendering unconstrained at their raw 22px SVG size
  ([rootguard-webapp#60](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard-webapp/pull/60)).
  Global search (not yet built) will adopt the same control style; the user
  menu consolidation is the next WebGUI navigation slice item.

The storage safety slice persists successful image history before deleting
anything. Cleanup retains the active and previous successful image and removes
only older IDs recorded by RootGuard. Global `docker system prune`, `docker
image prune`, and `docker volume prune` remain prohibited. Configuration,
AdGuard data, Unbound state, sessions, backups, and every unlabeled or foreign
volume remain protected. A cleanup that has nothing safely eligible records a
visible no-op instead of widening its scope.

## Remaining production milestones

1. Add richer cross-service health details to the Stack Center; five-service
   runtime, immutable metadata, and signed Core/WebApp release-attestation
   verification are delivered.
2. Harden backup retention, export/restore, and immutable release digests.
3. DNS security advisor and production preflight checks.
4. Native AdGuard integration, contextual guidance, cross-service diagnostics,
   and compatibility testing without duplicating filter, client, or query-log
   management.
5. Custom diagnostics and cache tools.
6. Runtime-provider abstraction for Docker and future bare-metal/systemd.
7. HTTPS for the appliance UI, sessions, roles, backup/restore, and installer
   hardening.

## Tracked editor follow-ups

- Extend the guided-assistant pattern to tightly scoped access-control rules.
- Generate and version the completion/documentation catalog for every directive
  supported by the installed Unbound release; the current catalog covers the
  common, safe RootGuard use cases.
- Expand semantic Advisor rules beyond the current security-, forwarding-,
  access-control-, and local-zone checks to cover more directive combinations.

## Release status

`v0.1.0-alpha.5` was published on 2026-08-01 as a GitHub pre-release with
public, digest-pinned `amd64`/`arm64` images for all four RootGuard components.
The release adds cryptographically verifiable GitHub build provenance for Core
and WebApp. Release workflow run `30700196286` built and attested Core before
installing the released stack and verifying recursive DNS plus DNSSEC
rejection. RootGuard remains in active alpha development:
update safety, backup/restore, broader authentication hardening and roles, and
bare-metal support are not yet production complete.
